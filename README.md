### XFINITY Character Viewer

This app will display a list of characters form a given show with multiple views. The app can easily be built into a new show by adding a new build flavor.

##### Process of building the app
1. Generate the basic app package with the known build flavors and push it to a VCS, in this case GitHub.
2. Build a basic UI and core logic
3. Add the API networking layer
4. Cleanup and add info activity

##### Non Android Tools Used
* Glide: Loads images from a URL into an ImageView
* OkHttp: For networking ease

##### Notes
* This was an enjoyable project to work on
* I'm not 100% happy with the UI but had to time box myself
* Given more time I would have also liked to add network error code logic
